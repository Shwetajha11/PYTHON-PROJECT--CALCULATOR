## Python Calculator Project Summary  

This Python project is a simple **calculator program** that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. It follows a **three-step approach**: defining functions, taking user input, and displaying the result.

### **Features and Functionality:**  
1. **Arithmetic Operations:**  
   - **Addition:** Computes the sum of two numbers.  
   - **Subtraction:** Finds the difference between two numbers.  
   - **Multiplication:** Multiplies two numbers.  
   - **Division:** Divides the first number by the second.  
   - **Average Calculation:** Computes the average of two numbers.  

2. **User Input Handling:**  
   - The program prompts the user to select an operation (1-5).  
   - It then asks for two numbers as input.  

3. **Result Display:**  
   - Based on the selected operation, the program calls the respective function and prints the result.  
   - If an invalid operation is chosen, an error message is displayed.  


### **Use Case:**  
This calculator project is useful for beginners learning Python and serves as a foundational project to understand functions, user input handling, and conditional statements.

NOTE- mistakly used "subtraction" instead of "substraction"
